# GSM_EFT_Neural_Network
Neural Network for predicting the multipoles of the correlation function following the Gaussian Streaming Model.

This code has been used to generate the data of this paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17834](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2024/08/049)
It was validated using the NSeries simulations

and then used to analyze the BOSS data.

Additionally, it was used to analyze and study the systematics for the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument.
